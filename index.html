      <h1>Monika Yadav</h1>
      <p>PhD Student in Sociology at Columbia University</p>
      <p>I am a sociologist of gender, race, and politics. My research examines the social construction of gender and race in the political sphere, with a focus on the United States. I use a variety of methods, including qualitative interviews, archival research, and computational text analysis.</p>
      <p>My dissertation, tentatively titled "The Gender of Politics," examines how gender shapes the political careers of women and men in the U.S. Congress. I am also working on a second project on the role of race in the 2020 presidential election.</p>
