          <div class="project-content">
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>Ethnographic fieldwork, semi-structured interviews, participant observation, multilingual fieldwork,
              qualitative coding</p>

            <h3>Core Skills</h3>
            <p>Deep qualitative inquiry, contextual research, complex stakeholder environments, cultural insights,
              behavioral analysis</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Led an immersive ethnographic study examining how migrant construction workers in India develop technical
              skills and navigate informal labor structures. Designed the research protocol, conducted 20 weeks of
              on-site observation at a large infrastructure project, and interviewed 40+ workers, subcontractors, and
              supervisors. Managed complex field logistics, built trust in a highly gendered and stratified work
              environment, and synthesized large volumes of qualitative data into a cohesive analytical framework
              explaining peer-led learning, risk regulation, and mobility-driven skill hierarchies.</p>

              insights, qualitative & quantitative triangulation, translating research into recommendations</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Led mixed-methods evaluations of both new faculty-driven instructional interventions and CTL’s flagship
              teaching programs. Designed assessment frameworks, analyzed quantitative and qualitative data, and
              translated findings into actionable recommendations for diverse instructional stakeholders.</p>
            <p>Evaluated faculty-defined teaching interventions by developing targeted assessment plans, conducting
              statistical analyses of exam performance, and completing a feasibility study of an AI-based learning
              intervention in a high-stakes nursing physiology course. Assessed the potential of generative AI to close
